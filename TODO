    - exim ?
    - higher-level vulns
        - directory traversal and invalid file write in attachment (CVE-2006-5487)
        - auth bypass ?
        - ACL bypass (https://bugs.exim.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3099#c4)
    - focus on partial part of code using snapshot-based fuzzing
- better demo in README

- AsanPass from readme-demo example into crate ?
