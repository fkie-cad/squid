    - exim ?
    - higher-level vulns

        - auth bypass ?
        - ACL bypass (https://bugs.exim.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3099#c4)
    - focus on partial part of code using snapshot-based fuzzing
    - how has exim been fuzzed already, how about other MTAs (postfix, ...), SMTP generell
    - LLM corpus generation and mutation (https://mengrj.github.io/files/chatafl-slides.pdf)
